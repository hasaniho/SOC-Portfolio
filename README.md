# SOC Analyst Practice Labs

Welcome to my SOC Analyst Practice Labs portfolio! This repository showcases my hands-on experience and projects related to Security Operations Center (SOC) work, focusing on skills like log analysis, threat detection, incident response, and using various SIEM tools.

## üìÅ Repository Overview

This repository contains write-ups, scripts, and examples of the labs I've completed as part of my ongoing cybersecurity training. The projects include work from platforms like TryHackMe, where I apply real-world SOC skills in simulated environments.

## üîç Key Skills Demonstrated
- **SIEM Tools**: Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar
- **Threat Detection**: Using YARA rules, signature-based detection, and MITRE ATT&CK framework
- **Log Analysis**: Identifying anomalies in log data to detect potential security threats
- **Incident Response**: Developing playbooks and responding to simulated security incidents
- **Scripting**: Python and Bash for automating SOC tasks

## üìö Featured Projects

### 1. [YARA Rules Lab](./YARA-Rules/YARA-Rules.md)
Developed custom YARA rules to detect malware within a simulated environment. Demonstrated skills in threat detection and signature-based analysis.

### 2. [Splunk Log Analysis](./Splunk-Log-Analysis/Splunk-Log-Analysis.md)
Used Splunk to analyze system logs and detect unauthorized access patterns. Created search queries and dashboards for monitoring network activity.

### 3. [Incident Response Simulation](./Incident-Response/Incident-Response.md)
Responded to a simulated phishing attack scenario. Developed a step-by-step playbook to handle the incident, showcasing strong analytical and response skills.

## üìÇ How to Navigate
- **Each project folder** contains a write-up (`.md` file) that details the scenario, tools used, steps taken, and outcomes.
- **Scripts and configurations** are included where relevant to show the practical implementation of skills.
